spec:
  # 1. TLS Configuration (for HTTPS)
  # To use this, you first need to create a Secret containing your TLS certificate and key:
  # kubectl create secret tls my-tls-secret --key /path/to/key.pem --cert /path/to/cert.pem
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - my-cool-shop.com
    secretName: my-tls-secret # This secret contains the SSL certificate

  # 2. Routing Rules
  rules:
  - host: my-cool-shop.com
    http:
      paths:
      # Requests to my-cool-shop.com/api/* go to the api-service
      - path: /api(/|$)(.*)
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: api-service
            port:
              number: 80

      # Requests to my-cool-shop.com/auth/* go to the auth-service
      - path: /auth(/|$)(.*)
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: auth-service
            port:
              number: 80

      # Requests to my-cool-shop.com/ go to the frontend-service
      # This should be the last rule to act as a catch-all for the domain.
      - path: /()(.*)
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: frontend-service
            port:
              number: 80
